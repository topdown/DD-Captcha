DD-Captcha
==========

DD Captcha is a drag and drop Ajax/PHP captcha package that aims to be unique for every site.

The goal is to have a re-usable captcha resource that can eaily be changed for each site to lower popularity of any give style.
In turn making it harder for bots to figure out the captcha or dedicate code in their program for one format.

* Having a naming convention, 
* with each site using its own thumbs 
* with unique file names so they can not be tied to one specific algorythem.

With that said

#### Do not use the images in the thumbs folder on your site. It will lower the security of the system. ####

*Instead make your own and edit the config file*


More will be added as development proceeds.
